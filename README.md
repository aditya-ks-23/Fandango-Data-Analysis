## Fandango-Data-Analysis
# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project repository. This project focuses on accurately predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. By exploring a variety of health-related variables, the aim is to enhance diabetes classification and contribute to early diagnosis efforts.

## Project Highlights

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics.
- Applied comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, outliers, One-Hot Encoding, and feature scaling.
- Developed and evaluated classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
- Fine-tuned model parameters using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.
- Addressed class imbalance using balancing class weight, Oversampling, and SMOTE techniques.
- Achieved balanced recall and precision results, ensuring robust diabetes prediction.

## Data

The dataset used for this project comprises health-related variables and diabetes outcomes. Unfortunately, we cannot provide the dataset due to privacy concerns. However, you can easily substitute it with your own data or explore publicly available healthcare datasets for similar analyses.
